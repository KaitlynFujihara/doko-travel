## What is Doko Travel?
Doko Travel is a web application that is targeted towards travelers that are going to Japan but don't know which cities to visit. Based on parameters such as duration of trip, and what kind of things the travelers are interested in, the application will generate recommended cities, including recommended length of time to spend in each city.
