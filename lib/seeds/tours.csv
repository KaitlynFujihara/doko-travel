Tokyo Tabi,"If you only have a few days in Japan (5 days or less), I would highly recommend spending your valuable time in Tokyo! Especially if you haven't been before. There are a ton of things you can do such as visiting Tsukiji's Fish Market, the Tokyo Skytree, Odaiba, and Asakusa. If your trip is 4-5 days, you should spend a day or two seeing areas around Tokyo as well. For example, Yokohama is just a quick train ride away! While in Yokohama you can visit the largest Chinatown in Japan and visit this beautiful port city. Tokyo is a perfect trip for people who want to experience what city life is like in Japan. The food is amazing, there is a lot of history, and the night life is incredible. ",5
Tokyo x Kansai,"The Tokyo x Kansai Tour is perfect for those who are spending a week in Japan. If you have never been to Japan this itinerary gives you a well-balanced view of what Japan is like (while still staying in tourist-friendly areas). The Kansai region of Japan includes notable cities like Kyoto and Osaka. I would recommend visiting Tokyo first (4 days), then taking a bullet train down to Kyoto. While in Kyoto, you can do a day trip in Osaka. Spending 2 days in Kyoto and one day in Osaka would be perfect. Kyoto boasts some of the most Japanese cultural experiences, in an accessible package for tourists. Many people like to dress up in Kimono (there are rental shops everywhere!) and walk up the long hill that leads up to Kiyomizu temple. After enjoying the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, you can enjoy the beauty of Kyoto. Other notable things to do in Kyoto include visiting Arashiyama and Kikankuji (the Golden Pavilion). If you are feeling adventurous, you can go towards the mountains and enjoy a more serene environment in towns such as Kibune. A one day trip to Osaka allows you to visit Umeda (the main downtown area) and Dotonbori (festive street with food, shopping, and huge neon signs).",7
Japan Highlights,"For those who plan to spend 10-12 days in Japan, this would be the perfect itinerary! Start your journey off in the big metropolitan hub, Tokyo. You can experience all of the things that city has to offer from the cultural/historical sites to the fun night life. Popular places to hit up would be: Tsukiji Fish Market, Asakusa, Harajuku, Shibuya, and Odaiba. After spending 3-4 days in Tokyo, I would recommend spending 3 days in the Kansai region (Kyoto and Osaka). The Kansai region has a very different feel than Tokyo. The people are a little more relaxed, and if you speak Japanese, you will realize that they speak a prefectural-dialect known as Kansai-ben. Spending a few days in Kansai (2 days in Kyoto, 1 day in Osaka) will allow you to experience this different culture. Kyoto is known for being a great place to experience traditional Japanese culture. In fact, you can still see geisha and maiko walking around the city going to practice. Make sure to try the matcha and tofu when you're in Kyoto! After visiting Kansai, you should make the trip down to Hiroshima. Hiroshima has an amazingly poignant museum about the atomic bomb of WWII and the negative effects. The Peace Park is something I would recommend to everyone. If you are a fan of Okonomiyaki (the delicious savory pancake made famous by Osaka), Hiroshima boasts their own version which includes oysters! If you have a little more time, I would recommend going to Miyajima (nearby island) for a day. This island is known for having deer roaming around everywhere. Make sure to try some momiji-manju (a delicious Japanese snack) and unagi (eel) as these items are famous on this island. ",10
Kansai Deep Dive,"If you have already been to Tokyo and would prefer to do a deep dive into what Kansai has to offer, this tour is for you! If you don't even want to bother flying into Tokyo, you can always use KIX (Kansai International Airport). I would recommend staying in Kyoto (as you would probably want to spend the most amount of time there). You can spend time doing the popular tourist attractions including Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion),  Ginkakuji (Silver Pavilion), Kiyomizu Temple, and Arashiyama, as well as, doing some more obscure things like venturing into the mountainside towns of Northern Kyoto and enjoying nagashi-somen (noodles that slide down a bamboo pipe and you fish out with chopsticks) while sitting over a flowing tiver. If you want to experience fun city-life in Kansai, head over to Osaka and indulge in the fun night life of Dotonbori. You can also visit Universal Studios Japan which has Harry Potter World. I would recommend exploring the Umeda area as well as there are some excellent places to enjoy food with a view of the city. If you're doing a Kansai deep dive, I highly recommend going to Kobe, a port city just 30 minutes west of Osaka. Kobe is known for their cute European-style cafes and cake/bread shops. If you need a break from Japanese food, Kobe offers a beautiful variety of food. Especially popular in Kobe is their beef, so make sure you try some when you're there. There are a lot of options to enjoy Kobe beef teppanyaki style. Teppanyaki is when the chef has a giant stove and cooks the food in front of you. Don't expect anything flashy like Benihana, these chefs are specifcally trained to cook Kobe beef, so it is likely they will barely speak a word to you because they are focusing on their craft. If you still have some time to spare, I would recommend visiting Himeji. Himeji castle is a popular place to visit, and it is not that far from Kobe!",10
Hokkaido Adventure,"If you have already been to Tokyo and are curious to see what else Japan has to offer, I would highly recommend visiting Hokkaido, specifically Sapporo. In my opinion, Sapporo has the best sushi in Japan, as their fish is extremely fresh. The sushi is also inexpensive in relation to what you pay in Tokyo. Other foods you HAVE to try when you're in Hokkaido, is soup curry, Jingesukan, miso ramen, and soft cream. You can visit the Shiroi Koibito (famous cookie) factory, or the Sapporo Beer Factory/Museum. If you go to Sapporo during early February, you can experience Yuki Matsuri (Snow Festival), which is an annual celebration that features giant snow and ice sculptures. It is truly impressive and is something I believe everyone should experience at least once. If you are going to Hokkaido during this time, there is a lot of snow so skiing and snowboarding is also an option. Noboribetsu is a city that is also fairly close to Sapporo and there are busses you can ride to get there. There are nice onsens in Noboribetsu and it feels more quaint. If you just want a short day trip out of Sapporo, you can go to Otaru, a city along a canal. There is also a sushi street in Otaru! If you are going to Hokkaido during the summer, there are a lot of beautiful flowers in bloom and the temperature isn't as hot as Honshu (mainland Japan).",5
WWII History Tour,"If you are curious about Japan's involvement in WWII (and the effects of the war) I would recommend visiting Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Both of these cities were hit by atomic bombs and both of these cities have great museums based on the effect of the war on Japan as well as more information about atomic bomb victims. While some of these exhibits can be very one-sided, I still highly recommend visiting at least one of the two. I would recommend staying in Hiroshima for 2-3 days so that you can also visit Miyajima (island off of Hiroshima) for one of those days. Miyajima is known for having wild deer roaming around. When you visit Nagasaki, I would recommend dedicating one or two days. People recommend doing a half-day trip to Hashima Island, which is an abandoned mining town.",5
Shikoku Deep Dive,"For those who are interested in seeing a more rural Japan, but want to stick close to Kansai, Shikoku is a great option. If you are spending some time in Kansai, Shikoku is just a short bus ride away. Shikoku is the smallest of the 4 main islands of Japan. While you're in Shikoku you can experience their main city, Tokushima, which will feel so quaint in comparison to Kyoto, Tokyo, or Osaka. You can experience Iya Valley and experience the Kazura Bashi which is  a famous vine bridge",5
