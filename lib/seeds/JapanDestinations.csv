Tokyo,"Tokyo doesn't even need an introduction! Who isn't familiar with this huge city? Let's be honest, when someone says Japan, Tokyo is your first thought. In my opinion, Tokyo is a must-do for everyone who is visiting Japan for the first time. I mean c'mon, you need to get your pictures at the Shibuya crosswalk, or go to a Maid Cafe in Akihabara. If you have a short trip to Japan planned, Tokyo is a great place to experience many of the things that Japan has to offer!",4
Okinawa,"Okinawa is an island chain off of the coast of Japan, technically part of Kyushu. If you are making the trek to Okinawa, I would recommend at least staying for a few days so that it is worth your while. The main city of Okinawa is Naha which has Shuri Castle. There is a short train that operates in the main city area, other than that you need to rely on bus. Many local Japanese will rent cars when going to Okinawa as it is a lot easier and more reliable than public transit. I would recommend doing some snorkeling, walking around the busy Odori Street, and drinking Orion beer to the sound of the sanshin (Okinawan instrument). The food of Okinawa is also very different than mainland Japan, they love ingredients such as goya (bittermelon) and pork. Make sure you try some of their specialties while you're there!",3
Sapporo,"This city is perfect for those who embrace the cold! This big city in Hokkaido has become known around the world for its annual Snow Festival which features giant and elaborate ice sculptures. This event happens in February. While you're in Sapporo make sure to check out some ski spots, sushi (freshest in Japan in my opinion!), miso ramen, beer, and nearby towns including Otaru (a canal city). If the cold isn't for you, visit in the summer and see the beautiful lavender fields while eating some of their fresh soft serve ice cream.",3
Shikoku,"Many people often forget about Shikoku when visiting Japan, but it has some of the most untouched beauty in Japan I have seen. Getting around by public transportation is a little more difficult when compared to the bigger cities in Japan, but it is totally doable! Shikoku is known for their amazing udon, so make sure to try an udon-making class. Another recommendation would be to see Kotohira-gu which is the main shrine for the multiple Konpira shrines located around Japan. Visiting Iya Valley is also at the top of list of places you must visit, you can see the famous Kazura Bashi which is a suspension bridge made of vines (now reinforced with steel). If you are in Shikoku for an extended period of time, you can also visit Dogo Onsen, a bath house, which is where the fictional character, Botchan, would frequent in the novel by Natsume Soseki.",3
Kyoto,"This city is dripping in traditional Japanese culture, while still being accessible to tourists. If you want to experience some traditional Japanese customs, this is where you should do it! Many people (locals included), rent kimonos and walk up to Kiyomizu-dera, a famous temple. There are many vendors and restaurants lining the road going up to the temple, so it's a great place to shop, eat, and people watch. The temple itself has a beautiful view of Kyoto and is not to be missed. Other fun things you can do in Kyoto is experience their amazing matcha products and tofu. The tofu speciality shops are not to be missed. Other popular destinations of Kyoto include Arashiyama (the famous bamboo forest) and the Kinkaku-ji (The Golden Pavilion). Just a short train ride from Osaka, this gem of a city is easy to get around by bus.",3
Hiroshima,"Hiroshima is most famously known for its role in WWII. Apart from seeing the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, you should also make sure you try the Hiroshima-yaki a different interpretation to the classic Osaka Okonomiyaki. If you are planning on staying in Hiroshima for longer than a day, I would recommend taking a day trip to Miyajima. This island can be accessed by a short ferry ride. You can encounter deer roaming the island and visit Itsukushima Shrine. If you're lucky, you can catch a traditional wedding or a Noh performance.",3
Osaka,"When I think of 'The Tokyo of the Kansai-region' I immediately think Osaka. Most people think of the famous Dotonbori area when thinking of Osaka. Streets lined with huge neon signs, most notably, the Glico Man and giant crab! While Osaka has an extremely fun night life scene, filled with bars, clubs, and arcades, this city has so much more to offer! The famous Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan is just a short train ride from Umeda (the central area). Want to experience the magic of Harry Potter World? Universal Studios Japan (USJ) is just a short train ride away! If you happen to go to USJ during Halloween, make sure you check out their version of Halloween Horror Nights. The scares are a lot different than in the states and I would highly recommend.",2
Fukuoka,"Fukuoka is the largest city in Kyushu and one of the most populated cities in Japan. It is actually closer to Seoul than Tokyo! If you visit Fukuoka, be sure to try the Hakata-style ramen which is the specialty in the area. It is also known for having ancient temples, beaches, and shopping. If Fukuoka sounds familiar, it is probably because it was where the Mongols targeted for their invasions in 1274 and 1281. The Japanese believed that Mongols were not able to reach Japan because of the kamikaze, or 'divine wind.'",2
Kobe,"Most people have heard of Kobe beef. It seems to be a hip, buzz-word thrown around Japanese restaurants. Many people don't know that Kobe (Koh-beh, not to be mistaken for the famous basketball player), is the home of this delicious beef. This port city has a lot of European influence because of it's history. For that reason there are a lot less Japanese restaurants here than you would find in another city. Kobe is filled with bakeries, pastry shops, and cute cafes serving Western-style food. Just a quick trip away from Osaka and Kyoto, this is a great day trip.",2
Nagano,Snow sports your thing? Nagano is the place to visit! Nagano is one of the prefectures that the Japanese alps lie in. Nagano is a great place to experience the nature of Japan as it isn't as commercialized as other big cities. I would recommend doing a roten-buro (outdoor hot spring) during the winter time. There is no better feeling than being surrounded by a snowy landscape while sitting in a natural hot spring.,2
Nagasaki,"Known for its unfortunate part in World War II, this city is now a popular tourist destination in Kyushu. The most popular museum in Nagasaki is the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum. This city has so much history and is a great stop for anyone with an interest in World War II. People also recommend doing a half-day trip to Hashima Island, which is an abandoned mining town.",2
Nara,"If you want to get away from the busy hustle and bustle of Osaka or Kyoto while in the Kansai region, I would recommend visiting Nara. Nara is famous for Todaiji, a famous temple housing the largest bronze Buddha statue in the world. Roaming the area surrounding Todaiji are deer who are known to bow for senbei (wafers) that you can buy at nearby carts. Inside the Great Buddha Hall is a large wooden beam with a hole going through the middle. It is said if you can crawl through the hole you will have good luck. If you visit during sakura season, I would highly recommend making the trek to Yoshino. Yoshino is a small town known for being the backdrop for many old Noh plays. It is known for having a mountainside completely covered in cherry trees.",2
Yokohama,"The literal translation of Yokohama is 'horizontal beach,' as it lies on Tokyo Bay. This port city is a great day trip away from Tokyo. Yokohama also has the biggest Chinatown in Japan, so the pork baos are not to be missed! If you stay in Yokohama longer than a day, be sure to a day trip to Kamakura to see the Daibutsu (huge Buddha) at Kotoku-In. Other popular attractions of Yokohama include the Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise Amusement Park, Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum, and the Yokohama Cup Noodles Museum.",1
Kagoshima,"Kagoshima is the capital of Kyushu and is known for its active volcano, Sakurajima. Kagoshima is known to have not only a warm climate but warm and friendly people as well. Kagoshima is known to have some of the most amazing hot springs in Japan, so I would highly recommend visiting one. There are also a few museums to exploring, a particularly popular one being the Chiran Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots. While Kagoshima is on the southern tip of Kyushu, I would recommend coming here if this is not your first trip to Japan and you are planning on visiting other cities in Kyushu. The journey to get here may take some time.",1
